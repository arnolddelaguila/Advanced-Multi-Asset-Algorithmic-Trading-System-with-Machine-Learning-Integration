## Strategies Implemented

### Simple Moving Average (SMA)

The SMA strategy calculates the average price over a specified period. This method helps identify trends and potential buy/sell signals.

### K-Means Clustering

This technique segments the market into clusters based on asset behavior. It allows traders to identify similar asset movements and optimize their trading strategies accordingly.

### Linear Regression

Linear regression analyzes the relationship between asset prices and other variables. This method helps in predicting future price movements based on historical data.

### Random Walk

The random walk model simulates price movements. It provides insights into the unpredictability of markets and assists in risk management.

## Machine Learning Integration

The trading system integrates several machine learning techniques to enhance decision-making:

### Deep Neural Networks (DNN)

DNNs are used for complex pattern recognition in financial data. They help in predicting asset prices based on historical trends.

### Strategy Optimization

Machine learning algorithms are employed to optimize trading strategies. This process involves fine-tuning parameters to maximize returns while minimizing risks.

## Backtesting

Backtesting is crucial for evaluating trading strategies. The system uses vectorized methods to simulate trades based on historical data. This approach ensures efficiency and accuracy in performance evaluation.

### How to Backtest

1. Load historical data for the assets.
2. Choose the trading strategy.
3. Run the backtesting function to evaluate performance metrics.

### Performance Metrics

The backtesting module provides various performance metrics, including:

- Total return
- Sharpe ratio
- Maximum drawdown
- Win rate
